An attempt to write a simple GB emulator in C# using only the .NET framework (i.e. no external dependencies). This ensures that it may run with Mono on other platforms than Windows aswell.
Given that the .NET framework does not provide audio support, it is unclear whether sharpGB will ever have this functionality.

The project's aim is to learn the internals of an emulator and to see how efficient C# will be for such a task.
